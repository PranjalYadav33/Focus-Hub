## 🎨 Design Guidelines

### Memphis Design Principles
- **Bold Colors**: Use the established color palette
- **Geometric Shapes**: Clean lines with playful shadows
- **Typography**: Maintain font hierarchy (Fredoka One, Righteous, Poppins)
- **User Experience**: No notifications, auto-save everything, clean interfaces

### Color Palette
```css
deep-space: #2E294E
electric-blue: #1B98E0
hot-pink: #E91E63
lime-green: #8BC34A
sunny-yellow: #FFD23F
coral: #FF6B6B
```

## 📝 Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React functional component patterns
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components under 200 lines when possible

## 🧪 Testing

While we don't have automated tests yet, please manually test:
- Timer functionality (start, pause, stop, reset)
- Data persistence across browser sessions
- Task management (create, edit, delete, complete)
- Dashboard statistics accuracy
- Responsive design on mobile and desktop
